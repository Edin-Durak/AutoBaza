# Car shop Landing countdown page 
One group of individuals tried to make a car selling platform for clients in our country, Bosnia and Herzegovina. They provided me with a Figma design so I could convert it into code. I used vanilla HTML/CSS/JS for this project as well. The reason is simple - simpler is better.

Unfortunately, the project is on hold for now due to financial issues. You can check the live website on this link: https://autobaza.ba/

As this is supposed to be a countdown landing page, I used Google fonts connected with CDN on the website. In the head tag of the HTML, I used all necessary meta tags for the best SEO score.

I used a desktop-first approach, as the main target for this website should be companies and potential clients. We assume that they would use a laptop/desktop for browsing this page mostly.

On the images below, you can see the desktop and mobile versions
