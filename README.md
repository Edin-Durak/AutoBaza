# Car shop Landing countdown page 
One group of individuals tryed to make a car seling platform for clients in our country Bosnia and Herzegovina.
They provided me Figma design so I can convert it into code. I used vanilla HTML/CSS/JS for this project as well. The reason is simple - simplier the better.
Unfortunetly the project is on hold for now dua to fininal issues. You can check the live website on this link: https://autobaza.ba/
As this is so post to be countdown landing page, I used Google fonts connectet with CDN on the website.
In the head tag of the HTML, I used all necessary meta tags for the best SEO score.
I used a desktop-first approach, as the main target for this website should be companies and potential clients. We assume that they would use a laptop/desktop for browsing this page mostly.
On the images below, you can see the desktop and mobile versions.
